# Developer Back End Test
The object of this test is to check your skills with different products that we use.  
1.   Please clone this repository onto your local machine.  
2.   Commit this to you own private github by changing the origin of the account without any modification on the master branch.  
3.   Create a branch Development on your private repo and push directly. This is where you work will begin.  
4.   Install composer and necessary PHP7.2 / MySQL onto your local machine. We don't mind that you use Apache but Nginx is preferable.  
5.   Install symfony onto your local workstation. Branch again to Symfony-Install. Add an ignore to vendors directory but add everything else and create a pull request to Development Branch with the commit.  
6.   Branch yet again making sure changes from Symfony-Install are merged.  
7.   Create a basic Entity called Software. It needs three fields.   
     > Id - INT 11 Unsigned Auto Increment  
     > ProductName - VARCHAR 50  
     > VendorID INT 11 Unsigned
8. Create an entity called Vendor. It needs 2 fields and has a FK to VendorID in Software Entity  
     > Id - INT 11 Unsigned Auto Increment  
     > VendorName - VARCHAR 50
